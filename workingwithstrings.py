'''
So above are some basic functions related for printing strings
Point to be noted this functions only help in printing
These functions do not change the strings
Like C++ strings are considered as array in Python. So you can print specific indices
index() function returns the index of a character that has been inputted or the starting index of inputted string
replace() replaces a mentioned part with the inputted part. It's a print replacement, not a literal change in the code
