#Sometimes I want some information back from a function
#Return keyword can help us to do that
#Suppose we want to cube a number

def cube(num):
   return num*num*num

print(cube(3))

result = cube(4)
print(result)

#We cannot add anything after we write "return" keyword. It works like a return statement.
